# SpaceX-Launch-Prediction
This project involves extracting SpaceX launch data, performing data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building machine learning models to predict the success of future launches. The goal is to determine which machine learning model best predicts the outcome of a SpaceX launch. This is a part of IBM - Data Science project
